# PowerPulse FrontEnd

This React App is the final student project created as a part of the unified PowerPulse
application project, with the
[back-end portion located here](https://github.com/kostarusin/power-pulse-back-end-node-js).
This application allows users to monitor their weight, level of physical
activity, calories intake, and more.

This project was built using [Create Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). For further
information and customization options, refer to the
[documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

Basic technologies and/or libraries used creating the application:

- reduxjs/toolkit
- react-redux
- redux-persist
- react-toastify
- react-datepicker
- react-infinite-scroll-component
- react-responsive
- react-router-dom
- axios
- formik
- yup
- lodash
- nanoid
- mui/material

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local
machine.

1. Make sure the LTS version of Node.js is installed on your computer.
   [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/) it if needed.
2. Install project dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Start the development mode by executing the command `npm run dev`.
4. Open the specified address in your browser, as shown in the terminal.

### Deployment

The production version of the project will automatically build and deploy to
GitHub Pages in the `gh-pages` branch whenever the `main` branch is updated. For
example, after a direct push or a merged pull request. To achieve this, edit the
`base` field in the `vite.config.js` file, replacing `react_vite` with your
repository name `"/your_repo_name"`, and push the changes to GitHub.

Next, go to the GitHub repository settings (`Settings` > `Pages`) and set up the
deployment of production version files from the `/root` folder of the `gh-pages`
branch, if it hasn't been done automatically.
